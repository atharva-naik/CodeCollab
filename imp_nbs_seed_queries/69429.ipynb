    "There are 4 sections in this project report. The 1st section implements a basic driving agent, which randomly choose action at each time step. The behavior of the basic agent is then observed. In section 2, we will discuss the choice of the agent's state, which will be used in the Q-learning algorithm. Section 3 implements the Q-learning algorithm. The code of Q-learning algorithm are illustrated in details including the data structure I use.  The choices of learning rate, discount factor and random action selection method I use in section 3 are the optimal choices which will be discussed in section 4. Section 4 firstly defines a performance evaluation metrics for the agent. Then the tunning parameters (learning rate, discount factor and random action selection method) are adjusted to find the best performance of the agent. After tunning the parameters systematically, the choice of the optimal tunning parameters and the best performance of the agent are reported. Based on the optimal tunning parameters, the generated Q-table will be explored in details. The conclusion will be made in the end of the report."

    "The **self.state** I defined is a list that consists of the current traffic light and **self.next_waypoint**. The current traffic light is obtained by **inputs[\"light\"]**. The **self.next_waypoint** is obtained by calling the **next_waypoint()** method of **RoutePlanner** class.  \n",

    "The **inputs** is a python dictionary obtained by calling the **sens()** method of **Environment** class. The keys of **inputs** are: **\"light\"**, **\"oncoming\"**, **\"left\"** and **\"right\"**. We only use **inputs[\"light\"]** as one of the states. The reason is as follows. First of all, I noticed that the **reward** is obtained by calling the **act()** method of **Environment** class. When I checked the **act()** method I found that the other dummy agents have nothing to do with the value of the **reward**, because the variable **move_okay** only depends on the traffic light no matter if there are other dummy agents at the same location. So, the **inputs[\"light\"]** is an important state that we need to consider during the learning. Besides, the **inputs[\"oncoming\"]**, **inputs[\"left\"]**, **inputs[\"right\"]** can be ignored because they represent the states of dummy agents.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The other state I want to add to my **self.state** is the **self.next_waypoint**. The **self.next_waypoint** is obtained by calling the **RoutePlanner** class' method **next_waypoint()**, which returns a proposed action according to the relative location between the location of the agent and the target. The reason of choosing **self.next_waypoint** as one of the states is as follows. When checking the **act()** method of **Environment** class, it can be noticed that before the agent arrives at the target, the highest value of **reward** (2) is assigned when the **action** is equal to the **self.next_waypoint**. So, **self.next_way** is also an important state for the Q-learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another import thing I need to mention is that **deadline** should not be included in **self.state** according to my opinion. The reason is that no matter what the value of **deadline** is, we always want to choose the **action** to be the correct one. So, the **deadline** is redundant to be included in the **self.state** for selecting the correct **action**. Besides, adding the redundant **deadline** to **self.state** increases the dimension of the feature variable so that more trails will be needed to train a feasible policy. Based on reasons above, the **deadline** should not be added into **self.state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal **action** we want to have is as follows: if the traffic light is okay to move, the ideal **action** should be **self.next_waypoint**; else, the ideal **action** should be **None**. So, our goal of this project is to build a table of Q-values by Q-Learning Algorithm such that the **action** chosen based on Q-values is the ideal **action**. And the implementation of Q-learning will be illustrated in the next section. "

    "We have already implemented the variable **self.n_success** for the performance evaluation in section 3. But in order to count the number of successes after the 90th trial, we also need to revise the **run()** method of **Simulator** class in the **simulator.py** by adding two lines of code, which resets the variable **n_success** of the agents to be 0 right after the 90th trial. The added code is shown as below:  "
