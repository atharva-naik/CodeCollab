    "# Basic Plotting\n",
    "Plotting functions is an essential task. It is important to be able to see how different aspects of a model behave, evolve, and depend on other aspects. This brief notebook illustrates the basics of plotting the function, $y(x) = ax^2+bx+c$. At the end of the notebook is the problem you must plot. \n",

One (of many ways) to do this, is to create an array of numbers for the independent variable (that goes on the $x$-axis) using ```numpy.arange```, which you have used before.
