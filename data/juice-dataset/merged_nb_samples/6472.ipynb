    "This notebook goes through the formulation of the ray-tracing equations used at the LCLS Skywalker project to automate alignment of the *hard x-ray offset mirrors* (HOMS) to points on two imagers downstream of the mirrors. Below is a schematic of the mirror systems in the *front end enclosure* (FEE), including the HOMS as well as the *soft x-ray offset mirrors* (SOMS). "

    "Of these mirrors only M1H and M2H will be used in the derivation but in principle should be applicable to any flat two mirror system including the SOMS. In addition to the mirrors, equations for the beam position at various imagers will be derived as well and are located right before M1H, between M1H and M2H and two after M2H. The coordinate system used in this notebook will be the same as shown in the diagram, with the $z$-axis going along the beamline, the $x$-axis running in the horizontal direction parallel to the ground and the $y$ axis running vertically off the ground. For all the calulations made, the small angle approximation ($tan(x) \\approx x$) was used as the range of the mirrors is only several microradians from the nominal position of 0.0014 radians. One final assumption made is that the imager normals run parallel to $z$-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "To the first order, the beam, mirrors, and imagers can be represented as lines in space where the point of reflection/contact would just be the intersection point of these lines. Knowing this, one can go through the beamline, component by component and calculate the expected $x$ position, $z$ position and angle of the beam at the point of contact or any point in between. To actually do the derivation, the python package [sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) was used. It is a package to perform symbolic mathematics within the python langauge.\n",
