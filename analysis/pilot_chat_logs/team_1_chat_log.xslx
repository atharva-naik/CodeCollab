1,Armineh,Let's get started,,
2,Armineh,"In the first exercise, Yiqing is the driver, Kelly is the navigator, and Luke is the researcher",,
3,Armineh,You have about 12 minutes to finish the first analysis,,
4,Armineh,"No need to share screen, you will all see Yiqing's cursor",,
5,Yiqing,Are we supposed to discuss in the chat?,,
6,Kelly,I think so.,,
7,Armineh,yes you should use this chat window for all of your communication,,
8,Kelly,@yiqing can you execute the first cell?,,
9,Yiqing,Cool. So I'm at the first TODO. What do you think the values should be?,,
10,Yiqing,Yes I executed the first two cells,,
11,Luke,"We're just all cooperating to fill out these to-dos, yes? I'm not sure I'm understanding the roles right.",,
12,Yiqing,I think so?,,
13,Kelly,"I think @luke you are the researcher, I'm the navigator",,
14,Kelly,yiqing fills out the missing part in the notebook,,
15,Luke,"Okay so I think Column is genres (object) since that's what we're measuring, right?",,
16,Kelly,we can just use df_movies.columns to get the columns,,
17,Luke,Yeah I'm just not clear on what I'm researching,,
18,Kelly,yes,,
19,Yiqing,and how about the plot_type?,,
20,Armineh,you have about 5 minutes left for the first analysis,,
21,Kelly,I think it should be bar chart,,
22,Yiqing,I guess researcher means you can search for answers when the navigator is not sure?,,
23,Luke,Ah okay,,
24,Yiqing,like in string?,,
25,Armineh,correct researcher searches for answers on the web or from the primer,,
26,Kelly,"I'm not sure about the exact value, can you search online@luke?",,
27,Yiqing,"Yeah, like what the name of bar chart should be",,
28,Luke,Doing that now,,
29,Yiqing,Cool!,,
30,Kelly,"Hey @luke, can you also search the function I highlighted?",,
31,Luke,Okay try just 'bar',,
32,Yiqing,Awesome!,,
33,Yiqing,I think the column value is not correctt,,
34,Luke,I think we need a specific column for column_name,,
35,Luke,You're just passing it all the columns,,
36,Yiqing,It says we need the number of movies,,
37,Kelly,we could pass in COLUMN_NAME[0]?,,
38,Kelly,which cell are you referring to?,,
39,Luke,Also that's going to get very recursive quickly,,
40,Luke,COLUMN_NAME should be defined once,,
41,Kelly,I meant the argument in the last row in cell 7,,
42,Yiqing,32860?,,
43,Luke,"Is that what we're supposed to be editing for the visualization, though?",,
44,Kelly,COLUMN_NAME is still defined as movie_df.columns,,
45,Kelly,"Yes, for visualization, we only need to pass in one column name",,
46,Kelly,which could be the first element in COLUMN_NAME,,
47,Luke,Is that the correct column for analysis?,,
48,Kelly,I think we need to feed the whole list to generate the bar plot?,,
49,Kelly,"Since we only fed in one column name, we are only seeing one bar",,
50,Luke,No the bar plot is acting on one column,,
51,Luke,We just fed it a column with one value,,
52,Yiqing,It says number of movies in each genre,,
53,Kelly,oh I think we need to get the values in the genre,,
54,Luke,Yeah.,,
55,Yiqing,so let's just use the column name of genre?,,
56,Yiqing,cool,,
57,Kelly,and we need to use value_count() to get the unique values and their counts,,
58,Yiqing,It looks correct now,,
59,Yiqing,Ok the next TODO,,
60,Kelly,üëç,,
61,Kelly,"@luke, can you find the helper function that splits the list and insert the elements as new rows?",,
62,Yiqing,"I guess we need to find what ""HELPER_FUNCTION"" should be",,
63,Yiqing,it should be one of the built-in functions of dataframe,,
64,Luke,Looking for that,,
65,Kelly,"@yiqing, we can fill the two values in the next TODO",,
66,Kelly,"The COLUMN_NAME should be 'genre',",,
67,Kelly,PLOT_TYPE is 'bar',,
68,Kelly,Let wait till the df is updated by the helper function,,
69,Yiqing,but isn't the value of the following cells dependent on this one?,,
70,Luke,Wow okay I think we want to use the 'explode' function yes really,,
71,Kelly,Yes,,
72,Yiqing,Looks correct!,,
73,Armineh,Grear job!,,
74,Kelly,Yay!,,
75,Armineh,"There's no submission mechanism yet, you can simply save the dataframe and move on to the second analysis, but your roles are changing",,
76,Armineh,"Now, Kelly is the driver, Yiqing is the navigator, and Luke is the driver",,
77,Luke,Uh. You listed driver twice.,,
78,Armineh,ah sorry,,
79,Armineh,but I think we have to wrap up the exercise and collect feedback now,,
80,Armineh,since it's already 11am,,
81,Armineh,thank you all!,,
