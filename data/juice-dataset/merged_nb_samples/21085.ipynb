    "# Toronto Community Health Profiling by Cluster Analysis #\n",
    "This is pilot data science portfolio to cluster neighborhoods within the City of Toronto using socio-economic-health indicators.\n",
    "The dataset was compiled and sourced from Ontario Community Health Profiles Partnership website. The page can be found here (http://www.ontariohealthprofiles.ca/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a collection of indicators from multiple data sources to describe the Toronto community health profile at a  neighborhood level. These indicators are categorized by 10 different categories which include population, socio-demographic, language, marginalization index, primary care, emergency care, hospital admissions, adult health, prevention, injuries, palliative care and birth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: members of government agencies in Toronto Local Health Integration Network (TC LHIN), Minisitry of Health (MoH) and City of Toronto are interested in profiling the community health across Toronto at a neighborhood level. Basically, this will help them to establish the strategic plan for appropriate resource allocation (i.e., to reduce the potential gap between different social-income classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Stakeholders**:\n",
    "* Members from Ministry of Health and Long-term Care (MoHLTC)\n",
    "* Members from Toronto Local Health Integration Network (TC LHIN)\n",
    "* Members from Public Health Ontario (PHO)\n",
    "* Members from City of Toronto\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: to provide the community health comparison standards which are segemented at neighborhood level. Unlike hospital service providers (i.e., university teaching, pediatric, mental health), there is no clear peer group comparison standard established for community health service providers. Thus, we want to establish the community health profile segmenation across the City of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work**:\n",
    "* Collection of meaningful features - age group, education level, employment level, etc.\n",
    "* Other models: Gaussian Mixtures, K-Medioids, etc.\n",
    "* Other feature scalers: Log scaler, Min-Max scaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation for Clients**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Neighborhood identity & positioning strategy\n",
    "* Make the link between segmeneted neighborhood group association and household's behavior (income, health determinants)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Marketing effectiveness\n",
    "* Assess the household's behaviors (i.e., service usage/visits) to identify the bottle neck\n",
    "* Optimize the resource planning investment on the most demand neighborhoods (i.e., poor, high hospital visits, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Neighborhood Segmentation Framework - Evaluation\n",
    "* Evaluate the current vs. future state for peer group comparison at a neighborhood level\n",
    "* Identify area(s) that are not meeting the needs or demands (i.e., low income, high prevalence of chronic conditions, etc.)"
