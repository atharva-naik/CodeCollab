"The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.",the idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights which are likely to fit the training data but not generalize well by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights that is logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data and has a small size the default regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights see above regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights the result is that whereas regularization makes all the weights relatively small regularization drives lots of the weights to effectively removing unimportant features,
