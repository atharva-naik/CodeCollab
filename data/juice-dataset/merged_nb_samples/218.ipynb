The current working directory can be changed from the GUI using Settings -> GRASS working environment -> Change working directory or from the Console using the cd command. This is advantageous when we are using command line and working with the same file again and again. This is often the case when working with lidar data. We can change the directory to the directory with the downloaded LAS file. IN case we don't change the directory, we need to provide full path to the file. Note that command line and GUI have their own settings of current working directory, so it needs to be changed separately for each of them."
