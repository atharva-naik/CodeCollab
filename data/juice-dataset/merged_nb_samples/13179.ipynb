When an animal is taken into the shelter, it is given a unique identifier that is also used in the outcomes dataset. We have already investigated and performed exploratory data analysis on the [Austin Animal Center's intakes](https://aaronschlegel.me/austin-animal-center-intakes-exploratory-data-analysis-python-pandas-seaborn.html) and [animal outcomes](https://aaronschlegel.me/exploratory-data-analysis-shelter-cat-outcomes-pandas-seaborn.html) individually and found several interesting facets of information. In this analysis, we merge the intakes and outcomes dataset using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to enable us to perform exploratory data analysis on the merged data. With the data merged, we will be able to explore in more depth the transition from intake to outcome."

Interestingly, the time in the shelter for dogs appears to be relatively flat regardless of the age of the dog. Anecdotally, I have seen cats of a higher age remain at local shelters longer on average in general, so these results aren't too surprising in that regard. It is unfortunate, however; since cats are prolific breeders, and in an environment such as Austin, likely breed year round, there is a high chance kittens are coming into the shelter at a much higher rate than cats of an older age. As kittens are adopted much quicker than adult cats in general, older cats can end up staying in a shelter environment longer than younger cats. The data seems to confirm this, as the majority of the cat intakes (and intakes overall) are within 2.5 years of age."

    "In the outcomes analysis, we noted that an intact animal (not spayed or neutered) would not be adopted before being altered to help keep the animal population down. It was assumed that transfer outcomes represented intact animal intakes being transferred to a different facility to be spayed or neutered. Now that we have the intake sex and outcome sex data resulting from the combination of the two datasets, we can see if this assumption was accurate. The following plots the top 15 intake to outcome cases concerning overall volume, which we saw earlier makes up over 95% of all cases, by the animal's intact status upon intake and outcome."

    "First, it appears there are a few records that may be mislabeled, as the intake status is altered, but the outcome is intact, which would imply the spay or neuter operation was somehow reversed. Fortunately, however, this mislabeling appears only in four cases. As we can see from the `Intact -> Altered` bar plot, by far the most common intake to outcome is a stray intake to adoption, which shows that the animal is spayed or neutered without being transferred. This result indicates that our original assumption of intact animals being transported to partner facilities before being adopted was incorrect and that spays or neuters do occur on-site before adoption. The majority of altered animal intake to outcomes are either owners surrendering their pets to the shelter or the shelter returning a missing pet to its owner, followed by already altered strays being adopted.
