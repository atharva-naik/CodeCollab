    "# Assessing Risk of Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be using Python to create a portfolio of assets and analzing its risk. The risk of a portfolio of assets depends on the weights assigned to each asset in the portfolio as well as the relationships of each asset with each other (covariance). \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things to assess riskiness is by looking at its volatility (standard deviation) of the returns of each asset, which can be calculated by first finding the variance of the asset and taking the square root of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we will have to import the required libraries. The 4 most important imports in this project are:\n",

    "- Quandl (Financial and economic dataset API)\n",
