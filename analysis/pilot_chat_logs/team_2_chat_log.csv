1,Atharva Naik,Hi,,
2,Sireesh,hello!,,
3,Armineh,"Great, let's get started",,
4,James,Hello,,
5,Armineh,"In the first exercise, Atharva is the driver, Sireesh is the navigator, and James is the researcher",,
6,Sireesh,ok!,,
7,Armineh,you have about 12 minutes to finish the exercise,,
8,James,Okay,,
9,Atharva Naik,do I need to share my screen if I'm the driver,,
10,Atharva Naik,because I will be writing the code,,
11,Sireesh,or does the jupyter notebook auto-update?,,
12,Armineh,No need to share,,
13,Atharva Naik,cool,,
14,Armineh,you will all see atharva's cursor,,
15,Atharva Naik,thanks for clarifying,,
16,James,"Also: what resources am I permitted to use? Anything on the web, or just the primers?",,
17,Atharva Naik,should we get started folks?,,
18,Atharva Naik,I think anything on the web,,
19,Sireesh,let's do it,,
20,Atharva Naik,SO/Documentation was mentioned,,
21,Sireesh,"yeah, I think web should be fine",,
22,Atharva Naik,Except ChatGPT üòõ,,
23,Sireesh,üï≥,,
24,James,But ChatGPT can answer all of the questions XD,,
25,Sireesh,@atharva I still don't see your cursor?,,
26,James,Same,,
27,Atharva Naik,now?,,
28,James,"Yes, I can now",,
29,Sireesh,yeah!,,
30,Sireesh,"v cool stuff, this is a really swank interface",,
31,Atharva Naik,indeed,,
32,Sireesh,I think the first thing we need to edit is further down,,
33,Atharva Naik,gotcha,,
34,Sireesh,"I think COLUMN_NAME is ""genre""",,
35,Sireesh,"and PLOT_TYPE is ""bar""",,
36,Sireesh,did we run the cells above?,,
37,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
38,Sireesh,"ah, sorry, it's ""genres (object)""",,
39,Atharva Naik,It was genres I think,,
40,Atharva Naik,it worked now,,
41,James,Did we lose Sireesh?,,
42,Atharva Naik,do you guys see the plot?,,
43,Atharva Naik,I think so,,
44,Atharva Naik,this could be a potential issue with the real exercise,,
45,James,"Yes, the plot showed up",,
46,Atharva Naik,what if someone loses connection,,
47,Sireesh,"hi, back now",,
48,James,Welcome back,,
49,Atharva Naik,no worries,,
50,Armineh,goos point @atharva,,
51,Armineh,the interface isn't very intuitive either,,
52,Atharva Naik,first plot is done I think,,
53,Sireesh,yeah,,
54,Sireesh,"ok, I don't know what the helper function is",,
55,Sireesh,I don't know that that's true!! AST.literal_eval is p dangerous in a lot of cases,,
56,Atharva Naik,true,,
57,Sireesh,"also, fwiw, braces will be a problem for literal eval, iirc",,
58,Atharva Naik,it can execute malicious code,,
59,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
60,Atharva Naik,just realized that,,
61,Sireesh,"but anyway, not sure what the helper function is",,
62,Sireesh,@james?,,
63,Sireesh,"it seems like it should be something like ""expand""",,
64,Atharva Naik,I think we need some research here üòõ,,
65,James,I'm Googling,,
66,Atharva Naik,üëç,,
67,Atharva Naik,Another thing I was wondering was would everyone stick to their role in a real exercise?,,
68,Armineh,you have about 5 minutes left for the first analysis,,
69,Sireesh,lol,,
70,Atharva Naik,If time limits are concerned everyone might start googling,,
71,Atharva Naik,I have a strong urge to do so right now,,
72,Armineh,googling is allowed. that's what the researcher does,,
73,Sireesh,"I'm just here, no thoughts, head empty",,
74,James,explode(),,
75,Atharva Naik,Yeah I meant if the driver and navigator will also start doing it,,
76,Armineh,right,,
77,Atharva Naik,explode worked,,
78,Atharva Naik,thanks,,
79,Sireesh,noice,,
80,Sireesh,plot type is bar,,
81,Atharva Naik,ok,,
82,Atharva Naik,it worked,,
83,Sireesh,üéâ,,
84,Atharva Naik,how to submit?,,
85,Sireesh,go team,,
86,Armineh,submission link doesn't exist yet,,
87,Armineh,so you're all set. great job!,,
88,Armineh,let's move on to analysis #2,,
89,Atharva Naik,thanks,,
90,Atharva Naik,ok,,
91,Atharva Naik,what are the roles now?,,
92,Armineh,"now, Sireesh is the driver, Atharva is the researcher, and James is the navigator",,
93,Atharva Naik,got it,,
94,Sireesh,"alright folks, take the wheel",,
95,Atharva Naik,@Sireesh we can see you now,,
96,Sireesh,"cool, thta seems to work",,
97,James,Didn't realize we swapped roles,,
98,Sireesh,"yeah, I am the driver now",,
99,Atharva Naik,no worries,,
100,Atharva Naik,@James you are the navigator,,
101,Sireesh,"column name should be count, yes?",,
102,James,Cand count,,
103,James,And*,,
104,James,Maybe swap vote average and count,,
105,James,Nvm,,
106,Sireesh,what's our helper function?,,
107,Atharva Naik,yeah looking into it,,
108,James,We may need research,,
109,James,It might be cut,,
110,Sireesh,"yeah, cut seems to have worked",,
111,Atharva Naik,yeah cut/qcut seems to be the one,,
112,James,"Nice, that was what I was looking up when I thought I was still the researcher",,
113,Atharva Naik,I think I will be the navigator now?,,
114,Atharva Naik,And James will be the driver?,,
115,Sireesh,this...also doesn't seem like a great visualization?,,
116,James,"Alright, Should we move on to the next one? I assume I am the driver",,
117,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
118,Atharva Naik,I think with some formatting of floats and adding a hyphen?,,
119,Sireesh,"alright, let's research",,
120,Atharva Naik,column name is genre again I think?,,
121,Atharva Naik,vote_bins?,,
122,Atharva Naik,wait sorry,,
123,Sireesh,"we're using revenue, now, right",,
124,Sireesh,?,,
125,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
126,Atharva Naik,total,,
127,Atharva Naik,can you check the argument for agg?,,
128,Sireesh,"huh, I didn't know you could use total, I thought it'd be sum",,
129,Atharva Naik,@Sireesh,,
130,Sireesh,"""sum"" should work",,
131,Atharva Naik,gotcha,,
132,Atharva Naik,in quotes,,
133,Sireesh,string,,
134,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
135,Sireesh,"string ""sum""",,
136,James,problem with genre,,
137,Atharva Naik,it is genres,,
138,Sireesh,"also ""genres""",,
139,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
140,Sireesh,noice,,
141,Atharva Naik,"""genre"" again?",,
142,Sireesh,"""genres""",,
143,Atharva Naik,"yeah ""genres""",,
144,Atharva Naik,my bad,,
145,Sireesh,here's an important research contribution:,,
146,Sireesh,"should that be capitalized? revenue, I mean",,
147,Sireesh,"nvm, sorry",,
148,Atharva Naik,no,,
149,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
150,James,I think we are done?,,
151,Atharva Naik,Yeah,,
152,Sireesh,"yeah, looks like it",,
153,Atharva Naik,What are the polls for?,,
154,Sireesh,"it's a jitsi feature, jitsi is like a zoom alternative",,
155,Atharva Naik,gotcha,,
156,Armineh,"You can poll your collaborators I guess, but we're not using that feature for the exercise",,
157,Atharva Naik,yeah,,
158,Atharva Naik,Should we head back to the zoom?,,
159,James,Carolyn sent a message to go back to the main room,,
