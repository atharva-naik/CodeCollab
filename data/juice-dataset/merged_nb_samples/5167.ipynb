    "## Welcome!\n",
    "This is an introduction to cyREST and its basic API.  In this section, you will learn how to access Cytoscape through RESTful API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of RESTful API\n",
    "    * [This is a good introduction to REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)\n",
    "* Basic Python skill - only basics, such as conditional statements, loops, basic data types.\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of Cytoscape\n",
    "    * Cytoscape data types - Networks, Tables, and Styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Requirments\n",
    "This tutorial is tested on the following platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client machine running Cytoscape\n",
    "* [Java SE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\n",
    "* [Cytoscape 3.2.1](http://cytoscape.org/download.php)\n",
    "* Latest version of [cyREST app](https://github.com/idekerlab/cyREST/releases)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server Running IPython Notebook\n",
    "* Docker running [this image]()\n",

    "## 1. Import Python Libraries and Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use several popular Python libraries to make this workflow more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do I need to install all of them?\n",
    "_NO_.  Because we are running this notebook server in Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP Client\n",
    "Since you need to access Cytoscape via RESTful API, HTTP client library is the most important tool you need to understand.  In this example, we use [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library to simplify API call code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JSON Encoding and Decoding\n",
    "Data will be exchanged as JSON between Cytoscape and Python code.  Python has built-in support for JSON and we will use [it](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) in this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Setup for the API\n",
    "At this point, there is only one option for the cy-rest module: port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change Port Number\n",
    "By default, port number used by cy-rest module is __1234__.  To change this, you need set a global Cytoscape property from _**Edit &rarr; Preserences &rarr; Properties...**_ and add a new property __resr.port__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is happing in your machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac / Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://cl.ly/aLn4/how_docker_works.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://cl.ly/aM6d/how_docker_works_linux.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actual Docker runtime is only available to Linux operating system and if you use Mac or Windows version of Docker, it is running on a Linux virtual machine (called boot2docker).__  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### URL to Access Cytoscape REST API\n",
    "We assume you are running Cytoscape desktop application and IPython Notebook server in a Docker container we provide.  To access Cytoscape REST API, use the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```url\n",
    "http://IP_of_your_machine:PORT_NUMBER/v1/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where __v1__ is the current version number of API.  Once the final release is ready, we guarantee compatibility of your scripts as long as major version number is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check your machine's IP\n",
    "\n",
    "* For Linux and Mac:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ifconfig\n",
    "```\n",
    "* For Windows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ipconfig\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing JSON\n",
    "All data exchanged between Cytoscape and other applications is in JSON.  You can view the JSON data by using browser extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [JSONView for Firefox](http://jsonview.com/)\n",
    "* [JSONView for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer command-line, [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is the best choice.\n",
