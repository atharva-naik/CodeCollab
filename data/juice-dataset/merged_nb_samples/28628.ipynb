Interestingly, the evening peak is lower than the morning peak, and it shows up around mid-night (not evening rush hour). \n",
    "* 1) People try to take cabs in the morning to avoid being late to work, and they feel ok to take public transportation after work. \n",

    "**Interesting findings:**\n",
    "* 1) The hourly distribution shows that the number of airport trips peaks around 15PM, while the non-airport trips peaks ~2 hours later (rush hours). Also, the lowest count of airport rides shows at 2AM about when airports shut down. Other non-airport rides, on the other hand, goes almost completely down at about 5AM.\n",
    "* 2) The day-by-day distribution during the month shows **a very strong weekly seasonality**. The peaks of both airport and non-airport rides roughly show in Fridays and Saturdays, and the counts of both of the rides drop dramatically in Sundays.\n",
    "* 3) The count of the airport rides shows its maximum on Sept. 4th (Labor Day long weekend). People like to travel around during the long weekend!"
