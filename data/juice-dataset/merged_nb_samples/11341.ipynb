    "This code chunk seems pretty great for scraping a website and returning a DataFrame for me to then manipulate. Now I need to properly label the columns, drop the useless rows, relabel some rows and pivot the table. I am not going to keep whether a player was selected to the first, second, or third All-NBA team because the distinction I don't think is very relevant for this analysis. Why is it not relevant? Well, each team is restricted to the five starting positions, thus though Russell Westbrook may be a more valuable player than say Marc Gasol, he may not be as valuable as Curry or Harden, so he gets bumped to the second team despite being more valuable or 'better' than one of the first team players. What matters for this analysis is not how good a player is with respect to those playing his same position, rather what matters is how good he is with respect to the league as a whole. As such, being considered in the top ten or fifteen players league wide I think is a more relevant statistic than necessarily his rank at his position. "

    "## Why so much work and a loop that didn't work\n",
    "The code above probably seems like a lot, and I feel pretty confident that a more experienced Python user could have broken up those columns and counted players names in a much more efficient manner. But for me, this is actually a shortened version. Right where I noted that a 'challenge' arose, my first instinct was to take the code to split up elements of a cell using a loop (shown below). My thought was to create a DataFrame for essentially each column of names, break them apart to get rid of the position, put them back together and then merge all of them plus the year's DataFrame. From there I would then drop observations after 1976, then drop the years, stack the columns, count each observation, etc. I ran into problems because the loop didn't work. If I ran the code on each column, it works, but in trying to put it in a loop there doesn't appear to be a way to call the column as a variable. This is because the loop is just calling the string, for example 'name1', and not calling the actual column. So when the loop hits where it needs the actual variable column like at `df.column.str` it can't run cause there's nothing to run on. There might be a way to actually get a loop to call the variable properly, but I tried a lot of different things and nothing work. \n",
