    "\n",
    "You must build a very specific tower out of four differently colored pieces that can be stacked in any order. But when you start building, you don’t know what the correct order is. Upon assembling the pieces in some order, you can consult an architectural oracle (he goes by Frank) who will inform you if zero, one, two or all four pieces of the tower are in the correct position. Your tower doesn’t count as finished until the oracle confirms your solution is correct. How many times should you have to consult the oracle, in the worst case,2 to assemble the tower correctly?"

Since there are only 4 possible answers after a guess, and $4^2 = 16$ possible answers after 2 guesses, we need at least 2 more guesses to figure out the correct answer. This proves that the solution must be at least 3. Consider each of the 4 categories to see if it's possible to distinguish within each category using only 2 guesses."
