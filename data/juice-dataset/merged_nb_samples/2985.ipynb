    "One cannot acquire a new programming language without investing numerous hours.\n",
    "[R-Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) is an official manual\n",
    "maintained by the R core team.\n",
    "It was the first document that I perused painstakingly when I began to learn R in 2005.\n",

    "*Factor* is a categorical number. *Character* is text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in R is represented as `NA` (Not Available). When some operations are not allowed, say, `log(-1)`, R returns  `NaN` (Not a Number).\n",
