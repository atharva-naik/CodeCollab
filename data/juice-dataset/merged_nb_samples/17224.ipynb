    "We can see that we divided by around 8 the traveling distances in around 200 generations. Originally we generate 100 samples for the population, then we generated around 50 new samples per generation with crossover and mutation. So we succeed to find a stable minimum with only 10 100 samples instead of 35! (= 10^40). As this path remains stable for around 200 other generation, that means that this distance is a minimum (maybe only locale) stable. If, now we look at the steps at the beginning, it's not really stable as we can find a clearly better path few generations after. The main advantage of this solution is that we can quickly get a good result but you cannot be sure that this is the best one ..."
