10:37

Sireesh
Sireesh says:I think the first thing we need to edit is further down 
10:37
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:gotcha 
10:38
avatar
Sireesh
Sireesh says:I think COLUMN_NAME is "genre" 
Sireesh says:and PLOT_TYPE is "bar" 
Sireesh says:did we run the cells above? 
10:39
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:yeah 
10:39
avatar
Sireesh
Sireesh says:ah, sorry, it's "genres (object)" 
10:39
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:It was genres I think 
Atharva Naik says:it worked now 
10:40
J
James
James says:Did we lose Sireesh? 
10:40
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:do you guys see the plot? 
Atharva Naik says:I think so 
Atharva Naik says:this could be a potential issue with the real exercise 
10:40
J
James
James says:Yes, the plot showed up 
10:40
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:what if someone loses connection 
10:41

AN

10:41
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:first plot is done I think 
10:41
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:yeah 
Sireesh says:ok, I don't know what the helper function is 
Sireesh says:I don't know that that's true!! AST.literal_eval is p dangerous in a lot of cases 
10:42
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:true 
10:42
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:also, fwiw, braces will be a problem for literal eval, iirc 
10:42
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:it can execute malicious code 
Atharva Naik says:yeah 
Atharva Naik says:just realized that 
10:43
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:but anyway, not sure what the helper function is 
Sireesh says:@james? 
Sireesh says:it seems like it should be something like "expand" 
10:44
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:I think we need some research here üòõ 
10:44
J
James
James says:I'm Googling 
10:44
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:üëç 
Atharva Naik says:Another thing I was wondering was would everyone stick to their role in a real exercise? 
10:45

10:45
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:lol 
10:45
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:If time limits are concerned everyone might start googling 
Atharva Naik says:I have a strong urge to do so right now 
10:45
me says:googling is allowed. that's what the researcher does 
10:45
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:I'm just here, no thoughts, head empty 
10:46
J
James
James says:explode() 
10:46
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:Yeah I meant if the driver and navigator will also start doing it 
10:46

10:46
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:explode worked 
Atharva Naik says:thanks 
10:46

me says:let's move on to analysis #2 
10:47
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:thanks 
Atharva Naik says:ok 
Atharva Naik says:what are the roles now? 
10:47

10:47
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:got it 
10:47

James says:It might be cut 
10:51
S
Sireesh

10:51
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:yeah cut/qcut seems to be the one 
10:52
J
James
James says:Nice, that was what I was looking up when I thought I was still the researcher 
10:52
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:I think I will be the navigator now? 
Atharva Naik says:And James will be the driver? 
10:52
S
Sireesh
Sireesh says:this...also doesn't seem like a great visualization? 
10:53
J
James
James says:Alright, Should we move on to the next one? I assume I am the driver 
10:53
AN
Atharva Naik
Atharva Naik says:yeah
