    "successive generations. When cells divide, the DNA of a cell is\n",
    "replicated: two identical replicates of the DNA are made from one\n",
    "original DNA molecule. Well, not totally identical. When replicating\n",
    "human DNA, for instance, there are at least a few errors left after\n",
    "the replications. Like, on average, there are about seven nucleotides\n",
    "that do not match those from the original DNA. The cell includes\n",
    "machinery to detect and repair such mistakes, but even that machinery\n",
    "sometimes overlooks the mistakes and this could be passed to the\n",
    "organisms of the next generation. These replication mistakes are called\n",
    "mutations. Mutations can be harmless (changes in \"junk\" part\n",
    "of the DNA) or harmful (the organism with a mutated DNA does not\n",
    "survive), but some could be beneficial and make the organism better\n",
    "fit than the old generation. Organisms with better fitness would\n",
    "proliferate throughout the population. This process, called evolution,\n",
    "happens all the time, for all organisms on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our description of molecular background of evolution is very\n",
    "simplistic. But will suffice for now. In the previous lecture we\n",
    "learned about genes, units of heredity and segments of the DNA that code\n",
    "for proteins. Particularly interesting are mutations that change the\n",
    "coding sequence of the gene, as the resulting protein may\n",
    "have a different sequence of amino acids. It is \"may\", as different\n",

    "gene variants are called *orthologous genes*. The difference between\n",
    "genes arises due to nucleotide substitution, insertion of the \n",
    "sequence or deletion of the DNA sequence. The later two types of\n",
    "changes in the DNA are called indels. Another kind of mistake in the DNA\n",
    "replication appears where a part of the DNA is duplicated, that is,\n",
    "mistakenly appears several times in the new genome. As there could be\n",
    "now several genes encoding the same protein, all but one of these\n",
    "genes can be changed with no harm. Multiple copies of the same genes\n",
    "that are then, within a single species, changed accross the evolution,\n",
    "give raise to gene families, a set of similar genes that are all stem from the\n",

    "There is a great value of finding homologous genes within the same\n",

    "numerically. Sequences of DNA that we would like to compare need first\n",
    "to be aligned to expose the similarities and differences. This\n",
    "procedure is referred to as *sequence alignment*. Sequence alignment\n",
    "and scoring of similarity of sequences give rise to many different\n",

    "\n",
    "* gene function prediction: knowing the function of a gene in one\n",
