    "Engineers collect data and make conclusions based on the results. An important way to view results is with statistical charts. In this post we will build a bar chart that compares the tensile strength of 3D-printed ABS plastic under different printing conditions. We will add error bars to the chart to show the amount of uncertainty in the data. For this plot, the hieght of the bars represent the mean or average of the measured tensile stength in the sample of data. The error bars on the plot will represent +1/-1 standard deviation about the mean."
