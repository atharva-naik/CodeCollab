It is transforming the banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding. Lending Club operates at a lower cost than traditional bank lending programs and pass the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors in the form of solid risk-adjusted returns.\n",

Additional features include credit history, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. It is quite rich and is an excellent example of credit risk data.  Interestingly, Goldman Sachs’ new peer-to-peer lending platform called Marcus was built almost entirely using the Lending Club data.\n",
