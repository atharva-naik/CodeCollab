    "Nowadays,teachers are not much interacting with students due to which they don't know the prons and cons of students.Many of the students cannot recognize their weaknesses and this stops them from developing their skills.Proper student intervention procedure does not take place in many of the schools.They lag behind in academics and even their parents would not be able to help them if the time crosses.\n",

    "## 1.3 Problem Statement\n",
    "Many of the schools have hired us as data science consultants.If the students are made to understand their weaknesses,then,they can surely work on it and could improve themselves.We need to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate.\n",
