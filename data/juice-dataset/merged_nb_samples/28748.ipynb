    "A time series is said to have a unit root if it is described by the equation $y_t = b_0 + y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t$, where $\\epsilon_t$ is an error term with mean 0. Such a time series is not covariance stationary, i.e. its covariance changes through time. For example, a random walk has a unit root, and its covariance grows over time.\n",

    "The Dickey-Fuller test (available in `statsmodels`) tests for the presense of a unit root in a series."
