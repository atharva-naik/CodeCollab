    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, Black Friday is the Friday after Thanksgiving, or the last Friday in November. It's a shopping extravaganza in which stores typically open their doors extremely early and offer one-time only deals. In years past, people have been known to form lines outside the stores starting Friday at midnight in order to score the best deals, also known as doorbuster deals, on items that are expected to quickly run out, such as TV's and video game consoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years many stores have added a twist: they have started Black Friday on [*Thursday*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_%28shopping%29#Black_Thursday): Thanksgiving Day itself. It started a few years back with stores opening later in the evening, but JCPenney opened its doors at 2 P.M. on Thanksgiving Day 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few days before Thanksgiving 2015, [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/) surveyed 1,058 respondents on general Thanksgiving [questions](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015), such as whether they celebrate Thanksgiving with friends or with family or at all, what types of desserts and turkey stuffings they prefer, etc. They also asked respondents whether they would shop Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving Day itself. In this exploration and visualization, we seek to gain a little more insight on who does Black Friday on Thanksgiving Day using the data collected by FiveThirtyEight."
