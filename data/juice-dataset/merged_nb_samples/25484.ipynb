    "Board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic boardgames, like [Settlers of Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) have become hugely popular. A popular site where these types of board games are discussed and reviewed is [BoardGameGeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll be working with a data set that contains `80000` board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format by [Sean Beck](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman). The data set is stored in `board_games.csv`, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/blob/master/boardgamegeek/games.csv). If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission211Solution.ipynb).\n",

    "- `average_weight`: the average of all the subjective weights (0-5).\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting machine learning task might be to predict `average_rating` using the other columns. The data set contains quite a few missing values, and rows where there are no reviews. You'll need to remove these as you explore the data to make prediction easier.\n",
