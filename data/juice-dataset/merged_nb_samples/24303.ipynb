    "#### Written by David Terpay\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate some of the functionality of the binary search tree class I built. You can check it out in the binaryTree.py file as well as the attached classes found in the Linked_List, Stack, and Queue folder (I used this as my backend implementation).\n",
    "The documentation and all of the functionality as well as decriptions can be found at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:\n",
    "properties() takes care of calling nearly all the important functions in the BinarySeachTree class (apart from a few fun and challanging ones). You can individually call every single function by finding its name and making sure you know how to deal with the return type. \n",
    "\n",
    "***some functions do not return numerical data but the treenode objects themselves***"
