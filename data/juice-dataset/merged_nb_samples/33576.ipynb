    "# Testing and Evaluating Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Model evaluation supervised in machine learning revolves around holding back part of the data and seeing how the model deals with it. A model that performs well on new data is a model that can be expected to perform well in production, when all data is new and unlabelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good model evaluation is not just a single test on a single model. A well-tested model is tested many times with different configurations: this is known as hyper-parameter tuning. And a model that is rigorously tested is one that is pitted against other models: linear regression vs. trees vs. SVMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to test ML models thoroughly. Machine learning models aren't complete black boxes, but they're certainly more opaque than classic models. Machine learning models don't come with statistical assumptions that let you calculate the standard errors of coefficients, or let you assume that you have the [best estimator possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem).\n",
