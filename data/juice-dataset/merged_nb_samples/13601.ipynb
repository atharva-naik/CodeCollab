    "**Recall of the problem**: A lighthouse is somewhere off a piece of straight coastline at a position $x$ along the shore and a distance $y$ out at sea. It emits short flashes (perfectly collimated) at random times and hence at random azimuths, $\\theta$, from its position, _i.e._, $p(\\theta) = constant$. You see these flashes on the coast while walking along the shore. You record your position $D_k$ along the coastline at the instant you see a flash, but you do not record the direction the flash came from.\n",
